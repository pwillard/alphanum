This document is for the alphanums python tool.

* With it, you can generate alphanumeric strings that turn into evenly spaced images inside a PNG file.

* The default size of the PNG is 1024 x 1024 pixels.

* The tool is written un python 3 and should be run in a virtual environment with the pillow library installed.

* pillow==10.4.0

Its naeively simple tool as I am not a very good python programmer but it gets the job done and can be the basis for a more complex tool.
